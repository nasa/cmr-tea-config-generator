# CMR TEA Configuration Generator
A lambda project to generate [Thin Egress App][teacode] (TEA) configuration files using [Serverless][sls]

## Overrview
A set of lambda functions to run under the CMR domain name which generate a TEA configuration.

See: [Cumulus thin egress app][tea]

## Usage

The [run.sh](run.sh) command will execute many of the stages of the software needed
get the application started. To see the options supported, run `./run.sh -h`. To
start the application, run in one terminal window: `./run.sh -o`. This will install
the lambda functions and start the offline server. In another terminal window try
the following commands:

    curl 'http://localhost:3000/dev/configuration/tea/capabilities'
    curl -I 'http://localhost:3000/dev/configuration/tea/status'
    curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer uat-token-value' 'http://localhost:3000/dev/configuration/tea/provider/POCLOUD'

| Action       | URL                                       | Description |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Capabilities | /configuration/tea/                       | Describe the service |
| Capabilities | /configuration/tea/capabilities           | Describe the service |
| Status       | /configuration/tea/status                 | Returns the service status |
| Generate     | /configuration/tea/provider/{provider-id} | Generate the TEA configuration file |

## Building

1. Install serverless using one of these commands:
    * `npm install -g serverless`
    * `curl -o- -L https://slss.io/install | bash`
2. Plugin: `serverless plugin install -n serverless-python-requirements`
3. Plugin: `serverless plugin install -n serverless-s3-local`
4. Python dependencies: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
5. Install locally: `serverless offline`
6. Run some example URLS: `./run.sh -e`

### Docker

The Dockerfile defines a node image which includes python3 and serverless for
use as a build and deployment environment when running under a CI/CD system.

## Deploying to AWS

The [serverless.yml](serverless.yml) file will create an IAM role for the lambda
functions. It will use the following Role name:
`tea-config-generator-role-${self:custom.env}-${self:provider.region}` and will
use `arn:aws:iam::${aws:accountId}:policy/NGAPShRoleBoundary` for a Permissions
Boundary.

## Testing
Read the details in the ./run.sh script. There are functions which have all the
predefined parameters for running pylint and unit testing:

* Unit Testing: `./run.sh -u`
* Lint: `./run -l`
